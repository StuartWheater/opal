Description: Data integration Web application for biobanks by OBiBa.
	Opal is OBiBa's core database application for biobanks. Participant data, once collected from any data source, must be integrated and stored in a central data repository under a uniform model. Opal is such a central repository. It can import, process, validate, query, analyze, report, and export data. Opal is typically used in a research center to analyze the data acquired at assessment centres. Its ultimate purpose is to achieve seamless data-sharing among biobanks.
